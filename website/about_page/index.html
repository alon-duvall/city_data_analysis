  This website showcases various data analyses I've conducted using publicly available city datasets. It is hosted as a GitHub project page (repository: alon-duvall/city_data_analysis) and is currently deployed via GitHub Actions. I plan to make greater use of GitHub Actions going forward to automate updates and incorporate additional analyses.

The site serves multiple purposes: to develop and demonstrate my data analysis skills, to provide a project for my CV, and as a personal hobby. The data is sourced primarily from official city portals (e.g., data.boston.gov), with the goal of uncovering meaningful trends or making nontrivial predictions about city-related metrics.
